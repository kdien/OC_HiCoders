        <h1>PHP</h1>
        <p>PHP <em>(<strong>P</strong>HP: <strong>H</strong>ypertext <strong>P</strong>reprocessor)</em> is mostly known as a server-side scripting language for web application development, though it is also a popular general-purpose language. Free and open-source, PHP is compatible with and supported on almost all servers used today running on various platforms (Windows, Unix-like, etc.).</p>

        <h2>What's good about PHP</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>It's simple and easy to learn. With familiar syntax to C-based languages and large community support, it's very quick and easy to get up and running with PHP.</li>
            <li>It's available on multiple platforms (Windows, macOS, Unix-like).</li>
            <li>It has extensive database support with more than a few free options available, making it cost-efficient to implement.</li>
            <li>Despite having been around for a while, PHP has still been getting major development with added modern capabilities like anonymous functions (lambdas), as well as performance improvement and framework support.</li>
            <li>PHP is still very popular, being at the core of the biggest blogging system (WordPress) and also running one of the most well-known social networks (Facebook).</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>What's not so great about PHP</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>There is virtually no IoT (Internet of Things) support on PHP, making it unfavorable for companies looking for more modern and innovative development solutions.</li>
            <li>Related to the first point, even though PHP has plenty to offer, it is often perceived as being old and insecure, especially "vanilla" PHP without any modern framework. This leads to top-level PHP developers' marketability getting wrongly reduced, as well as companies with focus on PHP getting misperceived as not being sufficiently "future-proof" or financially viable.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>What PHP can do</h2>
        <p>Beside its traditional main focus of server-side scripting, PHP can also be used for command-line scripting and even making desktop applications. With just a PHP parser, you can write PHP scripts that are executed using cron (on Unix-like systems) or Task Scheduler (on Windows). As for desktop applications, PHP is capabable of creating programs with a GUI, though that would require expertise understanding of the language as well as an extension called PHP-GTK.</p>
