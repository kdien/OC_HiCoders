        <h1>Java</h1>
        <p>Java was originally developed by James Gosling at Sun Microsystems, which since has been acquired by Oracle Corporation, and released in 1995 as a core component of Sun Microsystems' Java platform.</p>
        
        <h2>What makes Java fantastic</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Originally it was the only official language for Android development, though other languages have now been introduced. Yet it's still able to keep pace with the alternatives, and is close to the top.</li>
            <li>It's one of the most popular powerful object-oriented programming language.</li>
            <li>It's fairly straightforward, and if you have a basic understanding of frameworks, packages, classes, and objects, it's an easy language to grasp. And with a vast online community and many free online tutorials and courses, even novices won't be helpless.</li>
            <li>Java is a standard for enterprise applications.</li>
            <li>It's a highly secure language, though it isn't completely devoid of flaws, but developers have more options for security.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>What makes it upsetting to some developers</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Soon you will need to pay for a license to use it commercially, in 2019.</li>
            <li>High level languages such as Java have to deal with a common issue, poor performance (especially to start up), due to the compilation and abstraction level of a virtual machine.</li>
            <li>The code is verbose and wordy, making it hard to read and especially scan through. It's more approachable than C++, as it forces the developer to be more precise in their code, but it makes it a bit unwieldy and un-compact.</li>
            <li>Its use of operators are less clean than Python (e.g. Java uses <i>&&</i> instead of <i>and</i>).</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>When you should use Java</h2>
        <p>Java has such a wide use case range. It can be used to program pretty much anything from Android apps, desktop programs, to specialized systems like point-of-sale, trading applications, big-data programs, and even some of the every day household appliances (refrigerators, microwaves, etc.). Most organizations use Java for their proprietary internal systems, so demands for Java developers are always high.</p>
