        <h1>Java</h1>
        <p>Originaly developed by James Gosling at Sun Microsystems, which since has been acquired by Oracle Corporation, and released in 1995 as a core component of Sun Microsystems' Java platform.</p>
        
        <h2>What makes Java fantastic</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Originally it was the only official language for android development, but since other languages have been introduced. Yet its still able to keep pace with alternatives, and is close to the top.</li>
            <li>Another Object-oriented programming language, OOP, where you can define the type of data, it's structure, and the set of functions applied to it. Your data structure becomes an object and is now manipulatable to create relationships with other objects.</li>
            <li>Fairly straight forward, and if you have a basic understanding of frameworks, packages, classes, and objects, its an easy language to grasp. And with a vast online community and many free online tutorials and courses, even novices wont be helpless.</li>
            <li>Java is a standard for enterprise computing</li>
            <li>A highly secure language. It isn't completely devoid of flaws, but developers have more options for security and it helps by covering a few issues on it</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>What makes it upsetting to some developers</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Soon you will need to pay for a license to use it, in 2019</li>
            <li>High level languages such as this have to deal with a common fact, poor performance. Due to the compilation and abstraction level of a virtual machine. However, it's not the only reason, java has it worse, due to a garbage collector, which is a useful</li>
            <li>The code is verbose and has to many words, making it hard to read and isn't good if you want to scan through to find a spot. Its more approachable then C++, as it makes the coder be more precise in their words, but it makes it a bit unwieldy and un-compact</li>
            <li>less clear then python, as it requires semicolons, doesn't use and, or, and not, instead using &&, ||, and !.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>When should you use it?</h2>
        <p>Most organizations use Java. It has such a wide use case range, but most make java invisible to the user so the question of WHERE to use it is often brought up.</p>
        <p>You can use it to program Android apps, Software products, Finance programs, Point of sale systems, Trading applications, big data programs, and even some of the every day household appliances might be coded with java. Perhaps even your microwave or alarmclock.</p>
