        <h1>C++</h1>
        <p>C++ originates all the way back to 1979, when an employee at Bell AT&T, Bjarne Stroustrup started working on the C language with classes. He borrowed features from other languages such as Simula, Ada, ML, CLU, and ALGOL 68. So in addition to C's features, C++ has classes, strong type checking, default function argument and basic inheritance. Up until 1983, it was simply called <i>C with classes</i>, until it received its official name. A new standard was released mid 2011, and it was highly influenced by the Boost library project.</p>
        
        <h2>What C++ is good at</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>It's highly portable between multiple devices.</li>
            <li>It's an object-oriented programming language and includes classes, inheritance, polymorphism, data abstraction and encapsulation.</li>
            <li>It has a rich function library.</li>
            <li>It allows exception handling and function overloading, which are not possible in C.</li>
            <li>It's fast, efficient, and has a wide range of applications.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>What C++ isn't the best at</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>The standard allows for things that might cause unexpected behaviors, such as not doing a boundary check on arrays, allowing improper type conversion, etc. It gives the developer more freedom to do work, but also requires them to do more work to make sure it works as intented. Yet an unexperienced developer can very easily corrupt the memory, which is hard to debug.</li>
            <li>It has very little memory management, so the user has to manage that themselves.</li>
            <li>Its object orientation system is highly basic compared to other languages.</li>
            <li>You can't create custom operators, though you can redefine existing operators.</li>
            <li>The syntax is complex, while the standard library is also quite tiny, so it can be difficult to learn with little prior programming experience.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>The use cases</h2>
        <p>C++ has a number of ways you can use it, such as games. It overrides the complexities of 3D games, optimizing resource management and helps to facilitate multiplayer networks. It's a fast language so it allows procedural programming for CPU intensive functions and gives greater control over hardware. GUI or Graphic User Interfaces are easily made via C++. Several Adobe products such as Premiere , Illustrator, and Photoshop are all scripted in C++.</p>
        <p>Web browsers also can utilize C++, despite being limited to scripting and applications; however, it's still preferred in cases where you need speed and reliability. As an example, both Google's back-end and Firefox's rendering engine are coded in C++. It also is used, as C is, for scripting MySQL, one of the most popular database management software. MySQL forms the backbone of a variety of database-based enterprises. On top of this, it is integral to most OS, such as Apple's macOS and Microsoft Windows, as well as the erstwhile Symbian mobile OS.</p>
