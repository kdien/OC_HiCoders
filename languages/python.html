        <h1>Python</h1>
        <p>Python is an open-source, high-level general-purpose programming language whose popularity has been constantly increasing over the past few years. It often tops many lists of recommended programming languages to learn, generating a lot of attention on the topic, and for good reasons.</p>

        <h2>Why Python is so popular</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>It's very easy to learn due to its design philosophy that focuses on code readability using significant whitespace, as well as syntax that reads a lot like plain English. Therefore, it's often recommended as the first programming language for beginners to learn.</li>
            <li>It has cross-platform support, so coders get the freedom of choosing their own system to have Python up and running on.</li>
            <li>It has huge community support with tons of libraries, making it capable for a wide variety of different projects.</li>
            <li>It's very flexible and supports multiple programming paradigms (procedural, functional, object-oriented, etc.), again giving choices for different types of developers and/or projects.</li>
            <li>Python is used by many big name tech companies (Google, Facebook, Netflix, Dropbox, etc.), adding to it the <i>cool factor</i>, as well as increased marketability for Python developers.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Python's limitations</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Partly due to its nature of being an interpreted language, Python's performance is generally slower than other compiled languages like Java or C++.</li>
            <li>Surprising lack of support for mobile development.</li>
            <li>Not a great choice for game development, especially graphics-intensive games.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>What Python is used for</h2>
        <p>As mentioned above, Python is one of the best general-purpose languages that can be used for lots of different projects, from scripting to web development, desktop application development, etc. One of the most popular and perhaps most important uses of Python is for AI/machine learning, which has been a major focus of several tech giants over the past few years to work hand-in-hand with IoT (Internet of Things), which is also well-supported by Python.</p>
