        <h1>JavaScript</h1>
        <p>JavaScript is a high-level, interpreted programming language which, together with HTML and CSS, is one of the three core technologies of the World Wide Web. It is most widely used for enabling interactive web pages that make websites more responsive and improve the experience for users.</p>
        
        <h2>What JavaScript is good at</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>It is very easy to implement JavaScript. Most modern web browsers have their own engine to interpret and render JavaScript, so it is basically just a matter of putting code in the HTML document, telling the browser that it is JavaScript and the rest is taken care of.</li>
            <li>JavaScript mostly runs on the users' computers (client-side), reducing the burden on the servers and thus improves user experience on the responsive and interactive web interface.</li>
            <li>JavaScript can load content into the web page only if and when the users need it, without the entire page having to reload.</li>
            <li>JavaScript supports <i>defensive scripting</i>, meaning it can test for what is possible in the browser and react accordingly.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Why many people don't like JavaScript</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Because of its client-side nature, JavaScript can be exploited for malicious purposes (think those annoying pop-ups that almost always lead to something bad).</li>
            <li>Every web browser has their own <i>interpretation</i> of JavaScript code, so user experience may vary across different web browsers. This leads to more testing and workarounds required to achieve consistency among browsers.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>What JavaScript is used for</h2>
        <p>JavaScript's uses have largely evolved over the years. At the beginning, it was just simply used to interact with forms and give feedback to users on what they entered using alerts and/or confirmations, and sometimes to add content to the document.</p>
        <p>When browsers started supporting and implementing the Document Object Model (DOM), JavaScript started becoming more and more powerful for enhancing how users interact with web pages. All the users' actions on the web page, from clicking on certain components to scrolling the page to pressing certain keys, can be <i>listened to</i> and <i>handled</i> by JavaScript manipulating various objects on the page to create a unique interaction.</p>
        <p>Thanks to these enhanced powers as well as the world's trend towards moving everything to the web, JavaScript's been constantly developed to add more and more features to what it can do, most notably the release of <a href="https://nodejs.org" target="_blank">Node.js</a> in 2009, an open-source, cross-platform run-time environment that allows JavaScript to be used for server-side scripting, opening up countless possibilities for what JavaScript can do. Also, hugely popular JavaScript libraries and frameworks like <a href="https://jquery.com/" target="_blank">jQuery</a>, <a href="https://angularjs.org/" target="_blank">AngularJS</a>, <a href="https://reactjs.org/" target="_blank">ReactJS</a>, etc. have only increased JavaScript's stand in today's World Wide Web. There is no sign of this once laughed at language slowing down anytime soon.</p>
