        <h1>C#</h1>
        <p>C# is a popular language developed by Microsoft. It runs on top of the Common Language Runtime (CLR) which will provide it with run-time support. It's one of the many Object Oriented Programming Languages.</p>

        <h2>What C# is good for</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>It allows developers to build applications that run on the .NET Framework. You can use it to create client applications, XML Web services, distributed components, database applications, and many more.</li>
            <li>It integrates well with Windows, which doesn't require any special configurations to get a C# program to run. It's also easy to deploy as long as the target server or workstation supports .NET.</li>
            <!-- <li>Microsoft makes it much easier for a group of developers to work on the same project. Visual Studio, a free-to-download IDE <i>(Integrated Development Environment)</i>, has integrated tools for change control, and code merges. They also offer Team Foundation Server versions of its software, and Enterprise options for larger development teams.</li> -->
            <li>C# is very popular and is one of common languages programmers learn, making it easier for companies to find developers for various projects.</li>
            <li>Being a compiled language, it is stored on a public-facing server in a binary form. Thus, if your server ever got hacked, the hacker wouldn't automatically get to read any sensitive data that might be written in the code. Although they'd still have the ability to run it through software to bring it to a readable format, it still might deter them.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>What C# is not so good for</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Despite having many benefits being a compiled language, every time you make a minor change, you have to recompile your whole C# program, which could lead to developers more likely to leave minor bugs, as they already spent all the time to compile it.</li>
            <li>Since C# is a part of the .NET framework, it means the server running the application must be Windows. Many newer companies work with Linux servers though, since it's a cheaper alternative, and thus aren't able to take advantage of C#.</li>
            <li>After a few OS upgrades, Microsoft will typically stop supporting older .NET frameworks. While having an old operating system installed might seem like a mistake for organizations to make, many of them hold onto the older versions because they aren't willing to modify all of their code to keep up with the newer .NET.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>What C# can be used for</h2>
        <p>C# has many uses and it is among the most popular languages used in today's world. C# is highly versatile, and can be used to create a ton of projects, including but not limited to mobile apps, cloud-based services, enterprise software, games, XML Web services, distributed components, database applications, etc. There is not much that C# can't do.</p>
