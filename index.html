        <h1>What is it about programming languages?</h1>
        <p>Software development is a dynamic field. New and in-demand programming languages, frameworks and technologies can emerge, rise to fame, and then fade away in the course of a few years. Developers need to constantly be learning new skills to stay relevant.</p>
        <p>Every year, <a href="https://stackoverflow.com" target="_blank">Stack Overflow</a> (one of the most popular websites featuring questions and answers on software development), conducts an Annual Developer Survey asking the developer community about everything from their favorite technologies to their job preferences. Part of the results, of course, shows how different programming languages rank in terms of popularity.</p>
        <p>For someone first looking to learn programming, the choices could certainly be very overwhelming as to which language to learn, whether just for fun or for specific purposes. That's why we created this website to introduce a few major programming languages, talk about their pros and cons, compare their use cases to hopefully help ease the barrier of entry for anyone curious and want to learn about programming.</p>
        <p>For a quick overall comparison between the languages, head over to our <a href="comparison.html">comparison table</a>. We also have a dedicated page for each language for more details on whichever one you find interesting and feel like digging in a bit more.</p>
        <p>Happy Coding!</p>
